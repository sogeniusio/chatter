## Dependencies

Be sure to install the following packages before installing this one.

1. [Laravel Popular](https://github.com/jordanmiguel/laravel-popular) - A Laravel package for tracking popular entries(by Models) of a website in a certain time. [See requirements](#laravel popular)

2. [Laravel Favorites](https://github.com/ChristianKuri/laravel-favorite) - Allows Laravel Eloquent models to implement a 'favorite' or 'remember' or 'follow' feature. [See requirements](#laravel favorite)

### Popular

Use the visitable trait on the model you intend to track

use \JordanMiguel\LaravelPopular\Traits\Visitable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Visitable;

    ...
}

### Favorite
Your User model should import the Traits/Favoriteability.php trait and use it, that trait allows the user to favorite the models. (see an example below):

```
use ChristianKuri\LaravelFavorite\Traits\Favoriteability;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
	use Favoriteability;
}
```
